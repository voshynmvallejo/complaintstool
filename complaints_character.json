We cannot open any window, as a draft would fill all rooms with this disgsting smell.  They did that for hours yesterday night and Wednesday night (great time, when people come home from school/work to stew in the standing heat indoors), they are picking up early today. HOW CAN IT BE THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE WITH OBVIOUSLY FAULTY EQUIPMENT???",
